      <description>Introduction A volcano plot is a type of scatter plot commonly used in biology research to represent changes in the expression of hundreds or thousands of genes between samples. It&amp;rsquo;s the graphical representation of a differental expression analysis, which can be done with tools like EdgeR or DESeq2. Volcano plots indicate the fold change (either positive or negative) in the x axis and a significance value (such as the p-value or the adjusted p-value, i.</description>

      <description>Welcoming to the CDSB and TIB workshops 2019 at the Center for Genomic Sciences in Cuernavaca, Morelos, Mexico.
  I have been using R and Rstudio for a while in some of my bioinformatics projects, which has given me the chance to learn the basics of the language. On this ocassion, I had the opportunity to delve into some more advanced topics by attending to the ‚ÄúCDSB Workshop 2019: How to Build and Create Tidy Tools‚Äù, an international workshop held at the Center for Genomic Sciences (CCG) of the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) in Cuernavaca, Morelos.</description>
